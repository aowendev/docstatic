The static site generator core doesn't provide any feature of its own. All features are delegated to individual plugins: the docs feature provided by the [docs plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs); the blog feature provided by the [blog plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs); or individual pages provided by the [pages plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs).

DocStatic is preconfigured to use the plugins required to support:

* KaTeX math equations
* Lunr search
* Mermaid diagrams
* OpenAPI docs
* GraphQL docs

For more information, refer to [Using Plugins](https://docusaurus.io/docs/using-plugins) in the Docusaurus documentation.
