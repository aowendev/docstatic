A DocStatic site is a single-page React application. You can style it the way you style React apps.

## Global styles

DocStatic uses the @docusaurus/preset-classic theme with CSS overrides in the /src/css/custom.css file. Any CSS you write in that file is available globally and can be referenced directly using string literals.

## Styling your site with Infima

DocStatic uses [Infima](https://infima.dev/) as the underlying styling framework. Infima provides a flexible layout and common UI components styling suitable for content-centric websites (blogs, documentation, landing pages). For more details, refer to the [Infima website](https://infima.dev/).

Infima uses seven shades of each color. We recommend using ColorBox to find the different shades of colors for your chosen primary color. You can use the tool on the [Example page](https://docstatic.com/example-page) to generate the different shades for your website and copy the variables into `/src/css/custom.css`.

## Dark mode

In light mode, the \<html> element has a data-theme="light" attribute; in dark mode, it's data-theme="dark". Therefore, you can scope your CSS to dark-mode-only by targeting html with a specific attribute.

```css
/* Overriding root Infima variables */
[data-theme='dark'] {
  --ifm-color-primary: #4e89e8;
}
/* Styling one class specially in dark mode */
[data-theme='dark'] .purple-text {
  color: plum;
}
```

## Mobile view

Docstatic uses 996px as the cutoff between mobile screen width and desktop. If you want your layout to be different in the mobile view, you can use media queries.

```css
.banner {
  padding: 4rem;
}
/** In mobile view, reduce the padding */
@media screen and (max-width: 996px) {
  .heroBanner {
    padding: 2rem;
  }
}
```
