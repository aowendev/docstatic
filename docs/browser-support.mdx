DocStatic enables you to define the list of supported browsers through a [browserslist configuration](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist). Typically, websites should run well on any modern browser.

For more information, refer to [Browser support](https://docusaurus.io/docs/browser-support) in the Docusaurus documentation.
