By default, DocStatic is configured to use [Lunr](https://lunrjs.com/) search. Its main advantage is that it's a zero cost solution. Its main disadvantage is that the entire search index is downloaded to the user's browser; the larger your site gets, the slower it gets.

A variety of alternatives are available as Docusaurus plugins, including:

* Algolia (pre-installed)
* [Markprompt](https://github.com/typesense/docusaurus-theme-search-typesense)
* [Meilisearch](https://github.com/tauri-apps/meilisearch-docsearch)
* [Orama](https://github.com/askorama/orama/tree/main/packages/plugin-docusaurus-v3)
* [Typesense DocSearch](https://github.com/typesense/docusaurus-theme-search-typesense)

For more information, refer to [Search](https://docusaurus.io/docs/search#using-algolia-docsearch) in the Docusaurus documentation.
