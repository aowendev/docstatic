# Upgrading

While DocStatic is still in early development, changes must be merged individually from the main repository. However, the Node.js components can safely be updated by replacing the [package.json](https://github.com/aowendev/docstatic/blob/main/package.json) file with the latest version from the main repository. After updating, run:

```shell
yarn install
```
