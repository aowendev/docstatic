# docStatic

A composable documentation solution based on [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/) and [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/) (including tag management), [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/), [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) charts, [Lunr](https://lunrjs.com/) search integration and [Raw Loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/raw-loader) for code snippets.

The project was created by creating a new Docusaurus v3 site with Palo Alto Networks' [OpenAPI plugin](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/docusaurus-openapi-docs) and merging [Tinasaurus](https://github.com/tinacms/tinasaurus) to create a working config.

**Note**: Lunr search is available only in production.

This demo includes the use of snippets (partials), code snippets and variables (on the [Test Page](test-page)). It includes an example workflow for the *Docs* collection in Tina:

`Draft` → `In Review` → `In Translation` → `Translated` → `Published` ( → `Unlisted`)

Each state is a metadata Boolean, but the user interface in Tina treats them as a unified workflow.

## Local development

```shell
# clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:aowendev/docstatic.git

# cd in the project folder
$ yarn

# Start local dev server
$ yarn dev
```

> This installs dependencies and open the website in your browser.

Visit the CMS at [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin) to start editing.

### Generating OpenAPI Docs

To generate all OpenAPI docs, run this command from the root folder of your project:

```
yarn gen-api-docs all
```

> This generates API docs for all of the OpenAPI specification (OAS) files referenced in your `docusaurus-plugin-openapi-docs` config.

You can also generate OpenAPI docs for a single path or OAS by specifying the unique `id`:

```
yarn gen-api-docs <id>
```

Example:

```bash
yarn gen-api-docs petstore
```

> This only generates API docs relative to `petstore`.

If you have multiple versions of the same API, `gen-api-docs` only generates the latest. To generate all versions, use the `--all-versions` flag.

Example:

```bash
yarn gen-api-docs all --all-versions
```

> This generates API docs for all versions of all the OpenAPI specification (OAS) files referenced in your `docusaurus-plugin-openapi-docs` config.

### Cleaning API Docs

To clean/remove all API Docs, run this command from the root folder of your project:

```bash
yarn clean-api-docs all
```

You can also remove a particular set of API docs by specifying the unique `id` of your desired spec instance.

```bash
yarn clean-api-docs <id>
```

Example:

```bash
yarn clean-api-docs petstore
```

> This removes all API docs relative to `burgers`.

If you have multiple versions of the same API, `clean-api-docs` only cleans the latest. To clean all versions, use the `--all-versions` flag.

Example:

```bash
yarn clean-api-docs all --all-versions
```

> This cleans API docs for all versions of all the OpenAPI specification (OAS) files referenced in your `docusaurus-plugin-openapi-docs` config.

### Versioning OpenAPI docs

To generate *all* versioned OpenAPI docs, run this command from the root folder of your project:

```bash
yarn gen-api-docs:version <id>:all
```

Example:

```bash
yarn gen-api-docs:version petstore:all
```

> This generates API docs for all of the OpenAPI specification (OAS) files referenced in your `versions` config and also generates a `versions.json` file.

> Substitue `all` with a specific version ID to generate/clean a specific version. Generating for `all` or a specific version ID automatically updates the `versions.json` file.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` folder and can be served using any static contents hosting service. For example:

```
npm run serve
```

### Deployment

To deploy to production and support editing on your live website (at `your-company.github.io/baseurl/admin`), follow the steps from TinaCMS to [deploy to GitHub pages](https://tina.io/docs/tina-cloud/deployment-options/github-pages).
