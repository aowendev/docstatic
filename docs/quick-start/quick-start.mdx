# docStatic

A modern documentation platform, docStatic bridges the gap between writers and developers to create online documentation your users will love. 

It features:

* Content reuse and single sourcing.
* Simple structured authoring and semantic models.
* Content lifecycle and workflow management.
* Translation and localization support.
* Versioning and variant management.

Fully open-source, it combines a static site generator with a headless CMS and a publishing pipeline. Writers can work in a rich-text editor. Developers can work in Markdown directly in their favorite IDE. Users get a responsive documentation website with advanced features.

## Local development

```shell
# clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:aowendev/docstatic.git

# cd in the project folder
$ yarn

# Start local dev server
$ yarn dev
```

> This installs dependencies and open the website in your browser.

Visit the CMS at [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin) to start editing.

### Generating OpenAPI Docs

To generate all OpenAPI docs, run this command from the root folder of your project:

```shell
yarn gen-api-docs all
```

> This generates API docs for all of the OpenAPI specification (OAS) files referenced in your `docusaurus-plugin-openapi-docs` config.

You can also generate OpenAPI docs for a single path or OAS by specifying the unique `id`:

```shell
yarn gen-api-docs <id>
```

Example:

```shell
yarn gen-api-docs petstore
```

> This only generates API docs relative to `petstore`.

If you have multiple versions of the same API, `gen-api-docs` only generates the latest. To generate all versions, use the `--all-versions` flag.

Example:

```shell
yarn gen-api-docs all --all-versions
```

> This generates API docs for all versions of all the OpenAPI specification (OAS) files referenced in your `docusaurus-plugin-openapi-docs` config.

### Cleaning API Docs

To clean/remove all API Docs, run this command from the root folder of your project:

```shell
yarn clean-api-docs all
```

You can also remove a particular set of API docs by specifying the unique `id` of your desired spec instance.

```shell
yarn clean-api-docs <id>
```

Example:

```shell
yarn clean-api-docs petstore
```

> This removes all API docs relative to `burgers`.

If you have multiple versions of the same API, `clean-api-docs` only cleans the latest. To clean all versions, use the `--all-versions` flag.

Example:

```shell
yarn clean-api-docs all --all-versions
```

> This cleans API docs for all versions of all the OpenAPI specification (OAS) files referenced in your `docusaurus-plugin-openapi-docs` config.

### Versioning OpenAPI docs

To generate *all* versioned OpenAPI docs, run this command from the root folder of your project:

```shell
yarn gen-api-docs:version <id>:all
```

Example:

```shell
yarn gen-api-docs:version petstore:all
```

> This generates API docs for all of the OpenAPI specification (OAS) files referenced in your `versions` config and also generates a `versions.json` file.

> Substitue `all` with a specific version ID to generate/clean a specific version. Generating for `all` or a specific version ID automatically updates the `versions.json` file.

### Build

```shell
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` folder and can be served using any static contents hosting service. For example:

```shell
npm run serve
```

### Deployment

To deploy to production and support editing on your live website (at `your-company.github.io/baseurl/admin`), follow the steps from TinaCMS to [deploy to GitHub pages](https://tina.io/docs/tina-cloud/deployment-options/github-pages).
