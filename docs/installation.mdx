# Installation

Welcome! This guide walks you through setting up DocStatic for the first time.

If you’ve never worked with GitHub or docs-as-code before, don’t worry — we’ll explain what’s needed, why, and where to find more detail.

## Prerequisites

You can run DocStatic locally (on your computer) or host it in the cloud.

For the easiest cloud setup, create free accounts with these services:

* [GitHub ](https://github.com/)— stores your content and tracks changes
* [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/) — enables browser-based editing
* [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/) — provides optional grammar and style checking

If you plan to run DocStatic locally (on your computer) instead, see the Requirements for local development.

***

## Requirements for local development

This section only applies if you plan to work locally. 

You'll need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a text editor. Two open-source options are:

* [Eclipse](https://eclipseide.org)
* [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)

You will also need to install Node.js for its build tools and Yarn for package management.

### Install Node.js

You need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18.0 or above.

Check if Node.js is already installed. Open a terminal (Command Prompt or Terminal app) and run:

```
node -v
```

If you see a version number starting with v18 or higher, you're good to go.

If Node.js is not installed or you have an older version:

1. Go to the [official Node.js downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) page.
2. Choose the LTS (Long-Term Support) version for your operating system. 

   The installer includes npm, the Node Package Manager, which you'll need in later steps.

   During installation:

   \* Keep the default options selected (these include required dependencies)
   \* When the installer finishes, close and reopen your terminal.
3. (Optional) if you work on different projects that need different Node versions, install nvm ([Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)). With nvm, you can switch between versions of Node without breaking your setup.


### Install Yarn

DocStatic uses Yarn for package management.

Check if Yarn is already installed. Open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```
yarn -v
```

If you see a version number, Yarn is already installed.

If you get a “command not found” message or similar error, follow the steps below:

1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt or Terminal app) and run:

```
npm install -g yarn
```

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
  On macOS or Linux, you might need to prefix the command with sudo to grant permission:

  ```
  sudo npm install -g yarn
  ```
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
  On Windows, you don’t use sudo. Just open your terminal as Administrator and run the command.
</Admonition>

## Get the DocStatic repository

DocStatic’s source code lives on GitHub. To start, you’ll make your own copy (known as forking), then download it to your computer (cloning).

To get started, fork and clone the [DocStatic repository](https://github.com/aowendev/docstatic).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/aowendev/docstatic.git
```

## Prerequisites

It is possible to use DocStatic locally or configure your own hosted deployment. However, for the easiest cloud deployment, you may want to sign up for accounts with:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/signup)
* [TinaCMS](https://app.tina.io/register)
* [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/register)

## Requirements

For local development, you should install an IDE. Two free open-source options are:

* [Eclipse](https://eclipseide.org)
* [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)

DocStatic consists of a set of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) packages. You will need version 18.0 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage multiple Node.js versions on a single machine. When installing Node.js, you should select all checkboxes related to dependencies.

Yarn is used for package management. The Yarn maintainers recommend installing Yarn globally by using the NPM package manager, which is included by default with all Node.js installations. Use the `-g` flag with `npm install` to do this:

```shell
sudo npm install -g yarn
```

Then go to the root of the docstatic/ folder and install the dependencies:

```shell
yarn install
```

## Project structure

After cloning the repository, you will see these files in the `docstatic/` folder:

```
docstatic

│   └── petstore.yaml

```

This isn't the complete list, but these are the main ones to be aware of.

### Project structure rundown

* `/apis/` - OpenAPI YAML files.
* `/blog/` - Blog MDX files.
* `/config/` - JSON files used by TinaCMS to configure DocStatic.
* `/docs/` - Docs MDX files.
* `/i18n/` - Translation files.
* `/reuse/` - Reusable content.
* `/src/` - Non-documentation files like pages or custom React components.
  * `/src/pages` - Any JSX/TSX/MDX file within this directory are converted into a website page.
* `/static/` - Static folder. Any contents inside here is copied into the root of the final build folder.
* `/docusaurus.config.ts` - A config file containing the site configuration.
* `/package.json` - A DocStatic website is a React app. You can install and use any npm packages you want.
* `/sidebars.ts` - Specifies the order of documents in the sidebar.

### Monorepos

If you are using DocStatic for documentation of an existing project, a monorepo may be the solution for you. For more information, refer to [Monorepos](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation#monorepos) in the Docusaurus documentation.

### Running the development server

To preview your changes as you edit the files, you can run a local development server that will serve your website and reflect the latest changes.

```shell
yarn dev
```

By default, a browser window will open at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Build

DocStatic uses a static site generator to build the website into a folder of static contents and put it on a web server where it can be viewed. To build the website:

```shell
yarn build-local
```

and contents are generated within the `/build` folder, which can be copied to any static file hosting service such as GitHub pages, Netlify or Vercel. For more information, refer to [Deployment](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment) in the Docusaurus documentation.
