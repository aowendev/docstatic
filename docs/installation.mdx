# Installation

Welcome! This guide walks you through setting up DocStatic for the first time.

If you’ve never worked with GitHub or docs-as-code before, don’t worry — we’ll explain what’s needed, why, and where to find more detail.

## Prerequisites

You can run DocStatic locally (on your computer) or host it in the cloud.

For the easiest cloud setup, create free accounts with these services:

* [GitHub ](https://github.com/)— stores your content and tracks changes
* [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/) — enables browser-based editing
* [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/) — provides optional grammar and style checking

If you plan to run DocStatic locally (on your computer) instead, see the Requirements for local development.

***

## Requirements for local development

This section only applies if you plan to work locally.

You'll need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a text editor. Two open-source options are:

* [Eclipse](https://eclipseide.org)
* [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)

You will also need to install Node.js for its build tools and Yarn for package management.

### Install Node.js

You need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18.0 or above.

Check if Node.js is already installed. Open a terminal (Command Prompt or Terminal app) and run:

```
node -v
```

If you see a version number starting with v18 or higher, you're good to go.

If Node.js is not installed or you have an older version:

1. Go to the [official Node.js downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) page.
2. Choose the LTS (Long-Term Support) version for your operating system.

   The installer includes npm, the Node Package Manager, which you'll need in later steps.

   During installation:

   \* Keep the default options selected (these include required dependencies)
   \* When the installer finishes, close and reopen your terminal.
3. (Optional) if you work on different projects that need different Node versions, install nvm ([Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)). With nvm, you can switch between versions of Node without breaking your setup.

### Install Yarn

DocStatic uses Yarn for package management.

Check if Yarn is already installed. Open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```
yarn -v
```

If you see a version number, Yarn is already installed.

If you get a “command not found” message or similar error, open a terminal (Command Prompt or Terminal app) and run:

```
npm install -g yarn
```

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
  On macOS or Linux, you might need to prefix the command with sudo to grant permission:

  ```
  sudo npm install -g yarn
  ```
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
  On Windows, you don’t use sudo. Just open your terminal as Administrator and run the command.
</Admonition>

## Get the DocStatic repository

DocStatic’s source code lives on GitHub. To start, you’ll need to make your own copy by:

1. **Create a fork** of the DocStatic repository
   Forking creates a copy that you can use to work independently on your own project.
2. **Create a clone** of your fork.
   Cloning makes a copy that is associated with the original fork that you made. This can be useful for fixing schema issues, should they occur later.

### Fork the DocStatic repository

1. Log in to your account in GitHub.
2. Visit [https://github.com/aowendev/docstatic](https://github.com/aowendev/docstatic).
3. Click Fork (it is usually to the top-right).
4. Leave the default Repository name in place.
5. Enter a description of your project.
6. Make sure Copy the main branch only is checked.
7. Click Create fork.

GitHub makes a new branch of the repository in your GitHub account.

### Clone your fork of the DocStatic repository

To create a clone:

1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Navigate to the repository for the fork.
3. Click on the repository to open it.
4. Click on **\<> Code** and then copy the url.
5. Open your terminal or command prompt and use `cd` to navigate to the location where you want to store the clone. For example, `cd Documents/Projects/`.
6. Enter `git clone` followed by the url of your clone.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/acme-projects/docstatic.git
```

***

## Install the project dependencies

If you're going to work locally, you also need to install the project dependencies. Use `cd` to navigate to the root folder of your cloned or forked DocStatic repository and install the packages:

```
cd docstatic
yarn install
```

Yarn will download everything listed in package.json. This may take a few minutes.

***

## Project structure

After forking or cloning the repository, you will see various files in your in your `docstatic/` folder. Below, we've included **some** of the project structure files and folders that you need to be aware of. **It is not a complete list of everything in the project**.

```

### Project structure rundown

* `/apis/` - OpenAPI YAML files.
* `/blog/` - Blog MDX files.
* `/config/` - JSON files used by TinaCMS to configure DocStatic.
* `/docs/` - Docs MDX files.
* `/i18n/` - Translation files.
* `/reuse/` - Reusable content.
* `/src/` - Non-documentation files like pages or custom React components.
  * `/src/pages` - Any JSX/TSX/MDX file within this directory are converted into a website page.
* `/static/` - Static folder. Any content inside here is copied into the root of the final build folder.
* `/docusaurus.config.ts` - A config file containing the site configuration.
* `/package.json` - A DocStatic website is a React app. You can install and use any npm packages you want.
* `/sidebars.ts` - Specifies the order of documents in the sidebar. Use this for your “table of contents” structure.

***

### Monorepos

DocStatic allows the use of a single repo that contains both the project code and the project documentation. In Docusaurus terminology, this concept is called a “monorepo”.

For more information, see [Monorepos](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation#monorepos) in the Docusaurus documentation.

***

### Preview changes

To preview your changes as you edit the files, you can run a **local development server** that will serve your website and reflect the latest changes.

Open a terminal or command prompt and enter:

```shell
yarn dev
```

By default, a browser window will open at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

***

### Build

DocStatic uses a static site generator to build the website into a folder of static contents and put it on a web server where it can be viewed. To build the website, use:

```shell
yarn build-local
```

The contents are generated in the `/build` folder, which you can copy to any static file hosting service such as GitHub pages, Netlify or Vercel. For more information, refer to [Deployment](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment) in the Docusaurus documentation.
