# Configuration

DocStatic site configuration is managed through the `docusaurus.config.js` file. For information about editing this file directly, refer to [Configuration](https://docusaurus.io/docs/configuration) in the Docusaurus documentation.

To use the CMS to edit the config, navigate to the [Settings](http://localhost:3000/admin#/collections/edit/settings/index) collection. From here you can configure the site logo, title, tagline and footer.
