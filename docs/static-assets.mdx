Static assets are the non-code files that are directly copied to the build output. They include images, stylesheets, favicons, fonts, and so on

You should put these assets in the `static` folder. Every file you put into that folder is copied into the root of the generated build folder with the folder hierarchy preserved. For example, if you add a file named `sun.jpg` to the static folder, it will be copied to `build/sun.jpg`.

This means that:

* For site b`aseUrl: '/'`, the image `/static/img/sun.jpg` will be served at `/img/sun.jpg`.
* For site `baseUrl: '/subpath/'`, the image `/static/img/sun.jpg` will be served at `/subpath/img/sun.jpg`.

## Referencing your static asset

### In the CMS

1. Insert a Link.
2. Enter the absolute path, for example /files/note.docx.
3. Enter the text to display.

### In Markdown

```markdown
You write a link like this: [Download this document](/files/note.docx)

Docusaurus changes that to: <a href={require('static/files/note.docx')}>Download this document</a>
```

For more information, refer to [Static Assets](https://docusaurus.io/docs/static-assets) in the Docusaurus documentation.
