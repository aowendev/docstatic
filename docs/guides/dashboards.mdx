DocStatic adds dashboard functionality to TinaCMS. Tina generates a GraphQL API using the filesystem in the Git repository as the database. Dashboards query the API (locally or in the cloud) and present actionable reports directly in the CMS. Dashboard functionality is currently considered beta. The functionality is fully tested, but the user interface is provisional and requires refinement. Dashboards update when the page is updated. If another user has made changes since you viewed a dashboard, you can click **Refresh** to update the dashboard.

  Depending on the amount of content in the system, some dashboards may take some time to load. These dashboards will typically update slightly faster when running locally.

## Viewing the dashboards

From the CMS, navigate to the Dashboards collection. At the top of the page is a status bar that shows the GraphQL connection. It indicates if you are connected to the cloud or localhost. If the localhost is available, it will always connect to the localhost. To use the cloud, ensure the local dev server is stopped. The status bar also displays the environment and checks all settings are valid.

## Viewing workflow status

The Content Overview dashboard show the total number of topics in the /docs path and the topics in each workflow status:

* Draft
* Review
* Translate
* Approved
* Published
* Unlisted

Click the status link to display all topics in that status.

Click Edit to open the topic for editing.

Click the Close icon to close the list of topics.

### Viewing recent activity

The Recent Activity section shows recently changed topics. You can filter the time range (All time, Last week or Last month) and set the number of results from 5 to 50.

## Viewing translation status

The Translations dashboard shows the status of each topic for the language selected from the list:

* Up to date: The last modified date of the translation is later than the source.
* Outdated: The last modified date of the source is later than the translation.
* Missing: There is a source file with no equivalent translation file.

## Viewing media reuse

The Media Library dashboard shows where content in the /static/img path is used. It shows the total number of files and images, file size, image paths and image sizes.

You can filter by:

* All content.
* Images only.
* Recent (7 days).
* Used.
* Unused.

For used content, click Used in n docs to display the topics where the content is used. You can then click Edit to edit those topics.

## Checking broken links

The Broken Links dashboard validates all the hyperlinks in the topics. The report includes number for:

* Total links.
* Valid links where a connection could be established. 
* Broken links where no connection could be established.
* Warning links where the connecton was rejected but the link could still be valid.

You can safely ignore warnings about http\://localhost if you are describing software running locally. But document links should be relative.

Warnings are typically the results of aggressive CORS/CORP policies that do not respect no-cors settings. You must manually validate these sites by clicking the hyperlink.

The dashboard lists files with problem links. You can open them by clicking Edit in either list.

The dashboard also provides a summary with the date when the report was run.
