# Math Equations

Mathematical equations can be rendered using [KaTeX](https://katex.org).

## Use

To use KaTeX from the CMS, embed the string in a **Passthrough** component. You can include a **Summary** that will appear inline when editing the topic.

### Inline

Write inline math equations by wrapping LaTeX equations between `$`:

```latex
Let $f\colon[a,b]\to\R$ be Riemann integrable. Let $F\colon[a,b]\to\R$ be
$F(x)=\int_{a}^{x} f(t)\,dt$. Then $F$ is continuous, and at all $x$ such that
$f$ is continuous at $x$, $F$ is differentiable at $x$ with $F'(x)=f(x)$.
```

<Passthrough
  summary="equation"
  string="

### Blocks

For equation block or display mode, use line breaks and `$$`:

```latex
$$
I = \int_0^{2\pi} \sin(x)\,dx
$$
```

<Passthrough
  summary="equation"
  string="
  $$
  I = \int_0^{2\pi} \sin(x)\,dx
  $$
