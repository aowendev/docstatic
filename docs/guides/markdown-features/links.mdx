# Markdown links

There are two ways of adding a link to another page: through a URL path or a file path.

```
- [URL path to another document](./installation)
- [file path to another document](./installation.mdx)
```

In the CMS you can add a link from the pasteboard by selecting a section of text and pasting it.

You can also highlight a section of text and click the Link icon to add a path.

Or you can place the cursor where you want the link to appear, click the icon and enter the path and the display text.

For more information on links refer to [Markdown links](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/links) in the Docusuarus documenation.
