# Footnotes

There is an extension to Markdown that provides footnotes, but its implementation is not consistent and it separates the content from the number. For example:

```markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language[^1] created by John Gruber[^2], now widely used in writing[^3].

[^1]: Markdown uses simple syntax to achieve text formatting.
[^2]: John Gruber created Markdown in 2004.
[^3]: Many platforms such as GitHub, Stack Overflow, and blog platforms support Markdown.
```

In DocStatic this would be represented as:

```markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language<Footnote summary="1"> Markdown uses simple syntax to achieve text formatting.</Footnote>
created by John Gruber<Footnote summary="2">John Gruber created Markdown in 2004.</Footnote>,
now widely used in writing<Footnote summary="3">Many platforms such as GitHub, Stack Overflow, and blog platforms support Markdown.</Footnote>.
```

The **Footnotes** component enables you add inline footnotes to your text.

1. Select **Footnotes** from the **Embed** list.
2. Edit the component.
3. Give it a **Summary**.
4. Enter the **Footnote**.

#### Example

Markdown is a lightweight markup language<Footnote summary="1"> Markdown uses simple syntax to achieve text formatting.</Footnote> created by John Gruber<Footnote summary="2">John Gruber created Markdown in 2004.</Footnote>, now widely used in writing<Footnote summary="3">Many platforms such as GitHub, Stack Overflow, and blog platforms support Markdown.</Footnote>.

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
  If two footnotes have the same content, they will only appear once in the footer and will share a number.
