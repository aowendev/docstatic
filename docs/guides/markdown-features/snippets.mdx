# Snippets

The **Snippet** component enables you to reuse content across your documentation. A snippet is a chunk of content that can be inserted inside one or more topics. When you make changes to the snippet, they are made wherever the snippet is used. This can be particularly useful for boilerplate text. Snippets have their own collection in the CMS and are contained in their own separate part of the repository.

1. Select the **Snippet** component from the **Embed** list.
2. Edit the component.
3. Enter the **Path** to the snippet (from the `/reuse/snippets/` folder).

#### Example

<Snippet filepath="example.mdx" />
