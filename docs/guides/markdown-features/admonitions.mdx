# Admonitions

The **Admonitions** component enables you to add styled admonitions.

1. Select **Admonition** from the **Embed** list.
2. Edit the component and select a **Type** (**Note**, **Tip**, **Info**, **Caution** or **Warning**).
3. Give it a **Title**.
4. Enter the **Content**.

#### Examples:

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
  Use note admonitions for supplementary information.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="tip" title="Tip">
  Use tip admonitions to provide advice that it's safe to ignore.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title="Info">
  Use info admonitions for information that's sufficiently important that it needs to stand apart from the rest of the text.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="caution" title="Caution">
  Use caution admonitions when something may prevent an intended action from being completed.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="danger" title="Warning">
  Use warning admonitions when there is a risk of injury, security breach or data loss.
</Admonition>
