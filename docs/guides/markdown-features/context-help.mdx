# Context-sensitive help

> "Context-sensitive help is a kind of [online help](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_help) that is obtained from a specific point in the state of the software, providing help for the situation that is associated with that state. Context-sensitive help, as opposed to general online help or online manuals, does not need to be accessible for reading as a whole. Each topic is supposed to describe extensively one state, situation, or feature of the software."â€”[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-sensitive_help)

Typically, context-sensitive help is implemented by having a help icon that users can click that will take them to the appropriate part of the documentation for the part of the software they are using. This involves creating a map of context URLs.

DocStatic automatically generates links to headings. However, if you change the heading, the link will change. For this reason, DocStatic provides the Context Help element. It enables you to add an anchor tag anywhere within a topic, and providing that the path to the topic is maintained, the link will not break.
