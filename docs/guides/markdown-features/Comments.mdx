The **Comment** component enables you to add comments that are visible in the CMS but not on the rendered page, even in the raw source.

1. Select **Comment** from the **Embed** list.
2. Enter a **Comment**.

#### Example:

<!-- hidden comment="This comment is invisible in the published website." -->
