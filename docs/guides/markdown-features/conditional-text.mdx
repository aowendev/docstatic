# Conditional text

The **Conditions** component enables you to wrap text in a set of conditions that determine when it should be displayed.
Conditions can be any combination of languages or user-defined conditions.
The text can be displayed if one or more conditions are met (OR) or only if all conditions are met (AND).
You can also specify fallback text to display if no conditions are met.

## Create categories and conditions

1. In the CMS, click  the **Conditions** collection.
2. Click the **Add** icon to add a new **Category**
3. Give it a **Name** and **Description**.
4. For each **Condition** you want to add:
   1. Click the **Add** icon.
   2. Name the **Condition** and give it a **Description**.
