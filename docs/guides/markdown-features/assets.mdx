# Assets

Sometimes you want to link to assets (for example, docx files, images and so on) directly from topics. DocStatic manages this through the static/ folder.

Any content placed in the folder will be available from the root of the published site. For example:

```
# Your doc
/website/docs/myFeature.mdx

# Some assets you want to use
/website/assets/docstatic-asset-example.docx
/website/img/docstastic-asset-example-banner.png
```

## Images

DocStatic provides two ways to add images to topics. For inline images you can click the **Image** icon to place an image in a topic. This works best for icons (![](/img/docs/example.svg)) and small images. Icons should be stored as pre-scaled SVG files. These will be inverted and have their color space rotated by 180° in dark mode.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Tip">
  You can use [Librsvg](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/LibRsvg) to scale SVGs. For example, `rsvg-convert example.svg -h 12 -f svg -o example.svg` sets a height of 12 points.

For larger images, it's better to use the Figure component.

1. Select **Figure** from the **Embed** list.
2. Edit the component.
3. Click the **Image** area to open the **Media Manager**.
4. Upload or select an image.
5. Give it a **Caption**.

#### Example

<Figure img="/img/docStaticDemo.jpg" caption="Example Figure" size="" />

The figure resizes based on the view window. Clicking it will open it at maximum size in a light box.

For more information about the Media Manager, refer to [Media Overview](https://tina.io/docs/reference/media/overview) in the TinaCMS documentation.

## Files

In the same way you can link to existing assets by using the path from the static/ folder in the URL. For example:

```
./assets/docstatic-asset-example.docx
```

For more information, refer to [Static assets](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/assets) in the Docusaurus documentation.
