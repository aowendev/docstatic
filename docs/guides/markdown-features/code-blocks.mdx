# Code blocks and snippets

DocStatic provides two ways to include code in your documentation. Both support syntax highlighting.

## Code blocks

1. Click the Code Block icon in the rich text editor.
2. Click the language list and select or search for a language.
3. Enter your code in the box.

Example:

```plaintext
This is some plain text.
```

## Code snippets

1. Select Code Snippet from the Embed list.
2. Enter a Title.
3. Select a Language.
4. Choose a file from the list. The list is populated with all the files in the reuse/code/ folder every time you run the dev server or do a build.

Example:

<CodeSnippet title="Code snippet example" language="xml" filepath="example.xml" />

The advantage of using code snippets is that there is a physical file that can be unit tested.
