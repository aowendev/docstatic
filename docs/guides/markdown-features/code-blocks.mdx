# Code blocks and snippets

DocStatic provides two ways to include code in your documentation. Both support syntax highlighting.

## Code blocks

1. Click the **Code Block** icon in the rich text editor.
2. Click the language list and select or search for a language.
3. Enter your code in the box.

#### Example:

```plaintext
This is some plain text.
```

## Code snippets

1. Select **Code Snippet** from the **Embed** list.
2. Give it a **Title**.
3. Select a **Language**.
4. Choose a file from the list. The list is populated with all the files in the `reuse/code/` folder every time you run the dev server or do a build.

#### Example:

<CodeSnippet title="Example Title" language="xml" filepath="example.xml" />

The advantage of using code snippets is that there is a physical file that can be unit tested.
