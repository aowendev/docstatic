# Diagrams

Diagrams can be rendered using [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) in a code block.

## Use

The CMS directly supports editing Mermaid diagrams.

1. Click the **Mermaid** icon.
2. Enter the Markdown in the box.

Click **Preview** to view your diagram.

#### Example:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
  Currently, zenUML diagrams are not supported and mind map diagrams may produce unusual behavior. Not all diagram types can be previewed in the CMS.
