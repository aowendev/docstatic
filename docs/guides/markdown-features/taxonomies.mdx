# Taxonomy tags

Taxonomy tags enable you to apply an [information architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture) to your site content. It should be applied to any documentation platforms you use, such as bug-tracking systems and wikis. The most restrictive tag requirements that you're likely to encounter are flat (non-hierarchical) systems that support only lower-case letters and underscores (`_`) without spaces.

DocStatic applies a three-tier hierarchy to taxonomy tags. To prevent the tags becoming unreasonably long, nesting is limited to a maximum depth of three. In some cases, this requires flattening the structure (for example, while `regions_europe_uk_scotland` is logical, it has four levels and so must be structured as `regions_uk_scotland`).

When designing a three-tier information architecture, it's recommended that you aim to have around ten top-level categories, seven mid-level categories and as many leaf-level categories as you need. You should spell out acronyms and abbreviations, and aim to avoid redundancy.

## Editing taxonomy tags

1. From the **Taxonomies** collection, **Add** a taxonomy.
2. Give it a **Tag** using only lower-case letters.
3. Add any **Children**, and give them a tag, starting with the parent tag followed by an underscore.
4. For each child, add any Children.

  You can enter tags without the preceding tag name and an underscore, but if you do when adding them to a topic, they will be presented as a flat list.
