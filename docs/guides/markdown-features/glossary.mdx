# Glossary terms

The **Glossary Term** component enables you to enter a key that maps to a localized term and description. The term is displayed underlined. Moving the cursor over the term shows the help cursor, and hovering displays the description as a tooltip. On touch-screen devices, tapping the term displays a pop-up definition.

## Managing glossary terms

You can edit the Glossary Terms collection in the CMS.

1. Click the **Add** icon ( **+** ) to add a new **Key**.
2. Edit the key and then click the **Add** icon ( **+** ) to add a new **Translation**.
3. Edit the translation.
4. Give it a **Language Code**.
5. Enter how the **Term** should appear in the text.
6. **Enter the Definition.**

The Glossary Term will use the language version for the page it is displayed on. If no definition exists, it will fall back to the source language.

## Using glossary terms

1. Select **Glossary Term** from the **Embed** list.
2. Edit the component.
