# Wikis

A wiki page is a web/documentation page that's designed for collaboration. They are easy to create and edit and are often used for internal team knowledge sharing as well as public-facing help content.

When working with wiki pages in the CMS:

* You create the wiki content in the /docs/wiki/ folder.
* Each file in the /docs/wiki folder gets a sidebar that is generated automatically, based on the file structure. 
* The sidebar means anyone can quickly create and preview content without having to update the table of contents.
* Wiki topics do not include metadata.

DocStatic can automatically link a category to its index document. A category index document is a document following this filename convention:

Named as `README` (case-insensitive): `docs/wiki/folder/readme.mdx`.

For more information, refer to [Autogenerated](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/autogenerated#autogenerated-sidebar-metadata) in the Docusaurus documenation.
