# Wikis

Content created in the `/docs/` folder must be manually added to the table of contents to appear in its sidebar. However, for content created in the `/docs/wiki/` folder the sidebar is generated automatically from the file structure. This enables developers and others to quickly create and preview content without having to update the table of contents.

DocStatic can automatically link a category to its index document. A category index document is a document following this filename convention:

Named as `README` (case-insensitive): `docs/wiki/folder/readme.mdx`.

When working with wiki topics in the CMS, metadata is excluded.

For more information, refer to [Autogenerated](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/autogenerated#autogenerated-sidebar-metadata) in the Docusaurus documenation.

## Create a wiki page in the CMS

1. From the **Wiki Pages** collection, click **Add File**.
2. Give it a **Title**.
3. Enter the content.
4. Click **Save**.
