# Create a doc

In DocStatic, you write your content as Markdown in files called “Topics”. Typically, you will create each topic yourself, although certain types of docs may have autogenerated topics.



<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
  GraphQL and OpenAPI docs are autogenerated from a server or schema.
</Admonition>

To create a topic:

1. From the **Topics** collection, click **Add File**.
2. Give it a **Title**.
3. (Optional) If you want to use the topic in context-sensitive help, give it a **Slug**. This is a fixed path from `/docs/`.
4. Give it a **Description**. This is displayed in the Doc Card List.
5. (Optional) Add any required [taxonomy](taxonomies) **Tags**.
6. (Optional) Set any **Conditions**.
7. Ensure the Workflow status is set to Draft.
8. Enter your content.
9. Click Save.

## Doc front matter

At the start of every topic is a section of YAML contained between two sets of three hyphens (---). DocStatic uses this for things such as:

* Conditional Text
* Taxonomies (doc tags)
* Workflows
