# Create a doc

In DocStatic, you write your content as Markdown in files called “Topics”. Typically, you will create each topic yourself, although certain types of docs may have autogenerated topics.

  GraphQL and OpenAPI docs are autogenerated from a server or schema.
</Admonition>

To create a topic:

1. From the **Topics** collection, click **Add File**.
2. Give the topic a **Title**.
3. (Optional) If you want to use the topic in [context-sensitive help](https://docstatic.com/docs/context-help), give it a **Slug**. This is a fixed path from `/docs/`.
4. Give the topic a **Description**. This is displayed in the Doc Card List.
5. (Optional) Add any required [taxonomy](taxonomies) **Tags**.
6. (Optional) Set any **Conditions**.
7. Make sure the Workflow status is set to **Draft**.
8. Enter your content.
9. Click **Save**.

## Doc front matter

At the start of every topic is a section of YAML contained between two sets of three hyphens (---). DocStatic uses this for things such as:

* Conditional Text
* Taxonomies (doc tags)
* Workflows

For more information, refer to [Create a doc](https://docusaurus.io/docs/create-doc) in the Docusaurus documentation.
