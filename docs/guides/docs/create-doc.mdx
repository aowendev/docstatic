# Create a doc

Topics are stored in the `/docs` folder. Typically you will create these yourself, although the GraphQL and OpenAPI docs are autogenerated from a server or a schema respectively.

1. From the **Topics** collection, click **Add File**.
2. Give it a **Title**.
3. (Optional) If you want to use the topic in context -ensitive help, give it a **Slug**. This is a fixed path from `/docs/`.
4. Give it a **Description**. This is displayed in the Doc Card List.
5. (Optional) Add any required [taxonomy](taxonomies) **Tags**.
6. (Optional) Set any **Conditions**.
7. Ensure the Workflow status is set to Draft.
8. Enter your content.
9. Click Save.

## Doc front matter

At the start of every topic is a section of YAML contained between two sets of three hyphens (---). DocStatic uses this for things such as:

* Conditional Text
* Taxonomies (doc tags)
* Workflows

For more information, refer to [Create a doc](https://docusaurus.io/docs/create-doc) in the Docusaurus documentation.
