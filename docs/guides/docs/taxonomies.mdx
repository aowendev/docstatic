# Taxonomies

The more information you have, the harder it is to find things. Markdown enables you to tag content, but without any checking for consistency. DocStatic enables you to apply an [information architecture ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture)to your content with a tag hierarchy organized by taxonomies.

## Designing an information architecture

Three tiers. Ten top leves. Seven mid levels. As many third (leaf) levels as required.

Lower case and underscores only.

Flat tag systems like wikis and bug-tracking systems.

## Managing taxonomy tags

Using tags in this way effectively creates an [index](/docs/tags).

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
  You don't have to include the parent and an underscore in a child tag, but if you leave them out then you'll be presented with a flat list of tags when you add a tag to a topic.
