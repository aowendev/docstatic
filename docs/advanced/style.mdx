# Style checking

One of the features most missed by writers working in docs-as-code is a good spelling, grammar and style checker. By default, spell-checking is provided by your web browser or integrated development environment. This may be adequate for simple websites, but if you need something more advanced then you need a dedicated grammar checker.

## LanguageTool

DocStatic is tested with [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/), an AI-based grammar checker that supports over 20 languages. It's free to [register](https://languagetool.org/register) for the basic plan. The [premium plan](https://languagetool.org/premium) adds style-guide support for individuals and teams. Tailored [businesses](https://languagetool.org/sales) plans are available. There is also a [discount](https://languagetool.org/premium) for students and non-profits.

## Self hosted

Because LanguageTool is open-source, you have the option of [self-hosting](https://languagetool.org/dev). In this case there are no subscription fees, but you will need a development team to set up your LanguageTool instance, and you'll have to provide your own support.
