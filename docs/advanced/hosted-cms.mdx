# Hosted CMS

One of the two core components of DocStatic is the CMS (the other is the SSG). Until now, you have most likely used only the local version, invoked from the command line with `yarn dev`. But DocStatic also supports two ways of using a hosted version of the CMS.

## TinaCloud

The easiest hosted CMS option is [TinaCloud](https://tina.io/docs/tinacloud). You can [register](https://app.tina.io/register) for a free account, connect it to your GitHub repository and start using it immediately. The free tier suports up to two users, which may be sufficient for lone writers and small docs teams. If you need more users, Tina offers a variety of [pricing plans](https://tina.io/pricing) for different budgets.

## Self hosted

Because TinaCMS is open-source, you have the option of [self-hosting](https://tina.io/docs/self-hosted/overview). In this case there are no subscription fees, but you will need a development team to set up your Tina instance and you'll have to provide your own support.
