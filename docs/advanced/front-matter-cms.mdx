When creating content in an IDE such as [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/), features provided by the CMS are not available. A typical workflow has developers create or edit content by directly modifying the MDX file in the IDE with writers cleaning up and tagging the content in the CMS. If the developer forgets to include a last modified date, then you have to look at the file properties to get that information. However, there is a lightweight CMS available as a plugin called [Front Matter](https://frontmatter.codes/). The DocStatic repository includes an example Front Matter configuration. For more information, refer to the Front Matter [documentation](https://frontmatter.codes/docs).
