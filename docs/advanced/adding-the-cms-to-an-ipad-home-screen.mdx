With Apple iPadOS you can convert any web page into a web app that runs in its own instance of Safari with its own icon on your home screen. You can use this ability to create an app for the cloud hosted CMS.

1. Sign in to the CMS.
2. Navigate to the collection you want to use as the landing page. For example, the **Topics** collection or the **Table of Contents**.
3. Tap the **Share** icon, tap **More** ( **â€¦** ) and tap **Add to Home Screen** ( **+** ).
4. Give the app a name. By default it will use TinaCMS.
5. Click **Add**.
