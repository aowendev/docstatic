# Notifications

DocStatic uses [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to send workflow notifications. Example review and translate notifications are included in the `.github/workflows/` folder. Some configuration in GitHub is required to enable them. You can also use them as the starting point to develop your own custom notifications.

## Email

The `email-review.yml `and `email-translate.yml` actions are triggered when either the review or translate tags are set on a markdown file in the main branch. To use them, add these [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/use-secrets) to your repository:

* `SMTP_SERVER`
* `SMTP_PORT`
* `SMTP_USERNAME`
* `SMTP_PASSWORD`
* `NOTIFY_EMAIL_TO`
* `NOTIFY_EMAIL_FROM`

You can get this information from your email provider. For example:

* [iCloud](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102525) (requires an [app-specific-password)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102654).
* [Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/pop-imap-and-smtp-settings-for-outlook-com-d088b986-291d-42b8-9564-9c414e2aa040)

## Slack

The `slack-review.yml `and `slack-translate.yml` actions use the same triggers as the email versions. To use them, add your Slack webhook URL as a secret named `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`. For more information, refer to [Sending messages using incoming webhooks](https://docs.slack.dev/messaging/sending-messages-using-incoming-webhooks/) in the Slack documentation.

## Teams

The `teams-review.yml `and `teams-translate.yml` actions work like the Slack versions. Microsoft is deprecating the **Incoming Webhooks** app for Teams from December 2025, but currently there isn't a publicly available GitHub method for sending Adaptive Cards to workflows. The workaround is to use curl:

```yaml
- name: Send Teams test notification
  run: | 
    curl --ssl-no-revoke -X POST \
    --location ${{ secrets.MS_TEAMS_HTTP_POST_URL }} \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{ \
      "type": "message", \
      "attachments": [{ \
        "contentType": "application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive", \
        "content": { \
          "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json", \
          "type": "AdaptiveCard", \
          "version": "1.3", \
          "body": [ { \
            "type": "TextBlock", \
            "text": "This is a test notification from GitHub Actions (Teams).", \
            "wrap": true }]}}]}'
```

1. In Teams, go to the channel you want to send messages, click the elipsis (**…**) and select **Workflows**.
2. Click **Manage**.
3. Click **New Flow**.
4. Search templates for webhooks and click **Send webhook alerts to a channel**.
5. (Optional) Edit the **Flow name**.
6. Sign in and click **Next**.
7. Select a **Team** and **Channel** from the lists and click **Create Flow**.
8. Copy the `MS_TEAMS_HTTP_POST_URL` and store it as a secret in GitHub and click **Done**.
