# Notifications

DocStatic uses [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to send workflow notifications. Example review and translate notifications are included in the `.github/workflows/` folder. Some configuration in GitHub is required to enable them. You can also use them as the starting point to develop your own custom notifications.

## Email

The `email-review.yml `and `email-translate.yml` actions are triggered when either the review or translate tags are set on a markdown file in the main branch. To use them, add these [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/use-secrets) to your repository:

* `SMTP_SERVER`
* `SMTP_PORT`
* `SMTP_USERNAME`
* `SMTP_PASSWORD`
* `NOTIFY_EMAIL_TO`
* `NOTIFY_EMAIL_FROM`

You can get this information from your email provider. For example:

* [iCloud](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102525)
* [Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/pop-imap-and-smtp-settings-for-outlook-com-d088b986-291d-42b8-9564-9c414e2aa040)

## Slack

The `slack-review.yml `and `slack-translate.yml` actions use the same triggers as the email versions. To use them, add your Slack webhook URL as a secret named `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`. For more information, refer to [Sending messages using incoming webhooks](https://docs.slack.dev/messaging/sending-messages-using-incoming-webhooks/) in the Slack documentation.

## Teams

The `teams-review.yml `and `teams-translate.yml` actions work like the Slack versions, but use the `jdcargile/ms-teams-notification` action.

To use them, add your MS Teams webhook URL as a secret named `MS_TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL`.

If the action cannot be resolved, you may need to use a different maintained MS Teams notification action or send a POST request to the webhook using a script step.
