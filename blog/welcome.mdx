[Tinasaurus blogging features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog) are powered by the [blog plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog).

Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory.

The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:

* `2019-05-30-welcome.md`
* `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`

The blog supports tags as well.

**And if you don't want a blog**: just delete this directory, and use `blog: false` in your Docusaurus config.
