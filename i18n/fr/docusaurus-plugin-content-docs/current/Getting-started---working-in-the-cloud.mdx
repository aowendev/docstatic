# Getting started: Working with DocStatic in the Cloud

Welcome! This guide walks you through setting up DocStatic for the first time.

If you’ve never worked with GitHub or docs-as-code before, don’t worry — we’ll explain what’s needed, why, and where to find more detail.

## Prerequisites

You can run DocStatic locally (on your computer) or host it in the cloud. In this article, we explain how to host it in the cloud.

For the easiest cloud setup, create free accounts with these services:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/) — stores your content and tracks changes
* [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/) — enables browser-based editing
* [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/) — provides optional grammar and style checking

***

## Fork the DocStatic repository

DocStatic’s source code lives on GitHub. To start, you’ll need to fork it. This gives you a personal copy that you can use in your own repository, without affecting the original version.

1. Log in to your account in GitHub.
2. Visit [https://github.com/aowendev/docstatic](https://github.com/aowendev/docstatic).
3. Click **Fork** (it is usually to the top-right).
4. Leave the default **Repository name** in place.
5. Enter a description of your project.
6. Make sure **Copy the main branch only** is checked.
7. Click **Create fork**.

***

## Project structure

After forking and cloning the repository, you will see various files in your in your `docstatic/` folder. Below, we've included **some** of the project structure files and folders that you need to be aware of. **It is not a complete list of everything in the project**.

```

### Project structure rundown

* `/apis/` - OpenAPI YAML files.
* `/blog/` - Blog MDX files.
* `/config/` - JSON files used by TinaCMS to configure DocStatic.
* `/docs/` - Docs MDX files.
* `/i18n/` - Translation files.
* `/reuse/` - Reusable content.
* `/src/` - Non-documentation files like pages or custom React components.
  * `/src/pages` - Any JSX/TSX/MDX file within this directory are converted into a website page.
* `/static/` - Static folder. Any content inside here is copied into the root of the final build folder.
* `/docusaurus.config.ts` - A config file containing the site configuration.
* `/package.json` - A DocStatic website is a React app. You can install and use any npm packages you want.
* `/sidebars.ts` - Specifies the order of documents in the sidebar. Use this for your “table of contents” structure.

Next, let's look at where you'll need to create and store your documentation files.

***

## Clear the Docs folder

The Docs folder contains a copy of the DocStatic documentation. The idea is that you clear out the DocStatic documentation. When you create your own documentation, you should save it to the Docs folder.

***

## Monorepos

DocStatic allows the use of a single repo that contains both the project code and the project documentation. In Docusaurus terminology, this concept is called a “monorepo”.

For more information, see [Monorepos](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation#monorepos) in the Docusaurus documentation.

***

## Preview changes

To preview your changes as you edit the files, you can run a **local development server** that will serve your website and reflect the latest changes.

Open a terminal or command prompt and enter:

```shell
yarn dev
```

By default, a browser window will open at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

***

## Build

DocStatic uses a static site generator to build the website into a folder of static contents and put it on a web server where it can be viewed. To build the website, use:

```shell
yarn build-local
```

The contents are generated in the `/build` folder, which you can copy to any static file hosting service such as GitHub pages, Netlify or Vercel. For more information, refer to [Deployment](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment) in the Docusaurus documentation.
